## Class Notes
#### Ada Lovelace (United Kingdom | 1815-1852)
Ada Lovelace was a mathematician who collaborated with Charles Babbage (read more below) to create what was known as the Analytical Engine, or mechanical computer. Not only did she fully understand the way this computer should work, she also knew that this computer was more capable than Babbage knew. Because of her advancements, she improved computer science, stretching it from not just computing numbers as it was origianally intended for, but also to computing other programs..

#### Charles Babbage (United Kingdom | 1791-1871)
Charles Babbage was a mathematician who came up with the idea of the first computer, known as the Analytical Engine, and created the plans and blueprints for it. While at that time he was at a relatively high position in the government, he was thrown out of this position and never able to complete his computer. The computer that he designed was incredible complex especially considering it was fully mechanical with a functioning decimal system and memory. It was able to compute with "if" "then" statements, making it more capable of computing..
